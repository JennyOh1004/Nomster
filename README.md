# Yelp Clone Nomster Project


A yelp clone that integrates with the Google Map API and includes features user comments, start ratings, image uploading, and user authentication.

I created the web application using Ruby, Ruby on Rails framework, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap.

I set up the files such as MVC ( Models, view, controllers ).

The web application is to support user entered places, which indicates to store the details about the places users have entered someplace.

I add a form where users can update, edit, destroy the details of a place and comment form for adding the database table and models to store user-generated comments. And also, I made the rating field be a prepopulated dropdown.
